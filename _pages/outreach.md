I have been engaged in community outreach efforts in some form for over 5 years now.
Since high school, I have been an outspoken advocate for the queer community. 
My early school experience was tainted by homophobia and intolerance, so I have a personal stake in efforts to make schools, both K-12 and collegiate, more accepting of queer youth. In high school, I served as the president of the Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), working towards securing accessible, inclusive gender-neutral bathrooms for the student body.
