I am many things, but first and foremost I am an undergraduate research assistant with the University of Arizona Computer Science Department.
I work on the Science up to Par (s2par) project with Dr. Michelle Strout,
where I focus on the automatic parallelization of binary executables.

I also do experimental archaeology research as a University of Arizona Spirit of Inquiry grant recipient.
I work with Dr. Elena Hasaki on modelling ancient Greek pottery techniques,
where I focus on creating tools that aid in the data analysis process.


My research interests include:
* Program analysis and optimization
* Computability theory
* Compilers and programming languages
* Parallel programming
* Graph theory
* Archaeology

When I am not working on research, I enjoy music, yoga, and spending time with my fraternity brothers.
